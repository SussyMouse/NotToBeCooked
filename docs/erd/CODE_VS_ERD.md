# Code vs ERD

**Generated 10 September 2026 from `1633138` by `apps/api/scripts/erd_diff.py`. Do not edit by hand.**

`docs/erd/erd.mmd` is the schema of record; the code side is introspected from
live `SQLModel.metadata` and compiled against `postgresql.dialect()`, not read
off the source and summarised.

Nullability is **not** compared -- `erd.mmd` has no syntax for it. Types are
compared as families, so `string` and `VARCHAR` agree. See the script's
docstring for why both of those are deliberate.

> The hand-written version of this file, which this replaces, ended with the
> reason it now exists: *being ratified was not enough to get them done -- they
> needed a line in a diff.* That version is in git; the last one is at `1633138`.
